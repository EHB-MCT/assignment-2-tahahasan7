# Code of Conduct - budget tracker

## Our Purpose

The goal of this project and its community is to be inclusive and welcoming to the largest number of contributors, representing diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing a safe, friendly, and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of gender, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other personal characteristics.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within our community and the consequences for unacceptable actions. It is essential to foster an open, collaborative, and harassment-free experience for all contributors.

## Our Standards

To create a positive, welcoming environment, all participants are expected to:

- Use welcoming, inclusive, and respectful language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and feedback.
- Engage constructively in discussions and collaborations.
- Show empathy and consideration for fellow contributors.
- Accept responsibility and apologize for mistakes, and learn from them.
- Focus on what is best for the overall community and the project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Harassment, whether public or private.
- Publishing others' private information (such as physical or email addresses) without explicit consent.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces related to this project and extends to any public interactions where someone is representing the project. Representation can include official communications (email, social media) or attending events as a community representative. Project maintainers reserve the right to define and clarify what constitutes official representation.

## Expected Behavior

Participants are encouraged to actively engage in the community by:

- Being mindful of your speech and actions, contributing authentically to the health and growth of the project.
- Practicing collaboration before conflict.
- Avoiding discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
- Reporting unsafe situations, inappropriate behavior, or distress observed in the community.

Unacceptable behaviors may take many forms, including intimidation, discrimination, harassment, or demeaning speech. These behaviors will not be tolerated in any form within community spaces, at events, or in one-on-one communications.

## Harassment Includes

- Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate use of sexual images or imagery, including in presentations or shared content.
- Depictions of violence or inappropriate content.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of talks or events.
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at [taha.hasan@student.ehb.be]. All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and responded to appropriately. Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter’s identity and circumstances.

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines for handling violations:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or minor behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders with an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A more significant violation or repeated minor violations.
**Consequence**: A formal warning. Future violations will result in temporary or permanent restrictions on participation. No interaction with those involved, including maintainers, for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: Major violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from interactions and contributions in the community. No public or private interaction with community members during the ban period. Further violations may result in permanent removal from the community.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, or aggression towards others.
**Consequence**: Permanent ban from all community-related spaces, events, and contributions.

## Open Source Citizenship

We believe that being part of an open-source community means more than just following rules—it means taking responsibility for making the community stronger, more inclusive, and welcoming to all. If you see someone going above and beyond to foster a welcoming, friendly environment, please let us know.

Communities reflect the societies in which they exist, and we have a responsibility to act against inequality and abuse of power. Positive action is essential to build an environment where everyone can thrive.
